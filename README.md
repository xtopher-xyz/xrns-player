# xrns-player
Standalone XRNS playback in C. This library will unzip and parse the song data and instruments contained within an XRNS file. Realtime playback supports all pattern commands, parameter automation curves and most instrument modulation envelopes. Native Renoise effects are not supported, however a basic LPF, reverb/delay are available in-engine and as VSTs.

This library is useful for videogames and other realtime media projects that require tight integration with sequenced music playback. 

Full documentation and an example project are in progress.
